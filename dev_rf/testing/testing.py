# This file is going to be used to test Jeremy's mapreduce script.
# The objectives of the MapReduce are:
#   - Top 10 tags con mayores respuestas aceptadas
#   - Relaci√≥n entre cantidad de palabras en un post y su puntaje
#   - Demora de respuesta promedio en posts

# Tests have been done to what can be tested. The final results are outside a function
# so they cannot be tested in a separate file.
